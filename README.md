# Heart Disease Prediction

The **Heart Disease Prediction** project focuses on predicting the presence of heart disease in individuals using machine learning techniques. By leveraging popular Python libraries such as **NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn (sklearn)**, this project provides a comprehensive solution for accurate disease prediction.

## Project Overview

This project develops a model that can accurately predict the presence of heart disease based on various medical factors. Early detection of heart disease is crucial for timely intervention and treatment. By employing machine learning algorithms and a curated dataset, this project offers a valuable tool for predicting heart disease.

## Key Features

- **Data Collection and Processing:** The project uses a dataset containing features such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more. Using Pandas, the data is cleaned, preprocessed, and transformed for analysis.

- **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib and Seaborn are used to create histograms, bar plots, and correlation matrices, helping to understand patterns and correlations with heart disease.

- **Train-Test Split:** The dataset is divided into training and testing subsets to evaluate model performance on unseen data.

- **Classification Models:** Various models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines are used to predict heart disease.

- **Model Evaluation:** The project evaluates models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Confusion matrices are also used to compare predicted labels against actual labels.
